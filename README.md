TrackNest – Your AI-Powered Goal & Task Companion
TrackNest is an intelligent productivity and personal growth web application designed to help users set, manage, and achieve their goals with clarity, focus, and consistency.

🚀 What Is TrackNest?
TrackNest combines the power of AI, behavioral psychology, and smart UX to guide users from goal-setting to achievement. It doesn’t just help you list your goals — it helps you complete them with a realistic, step-by-step roadmap, personalized daily routines, and motivational reminders.

✨ Key Features

What is your deadline?

What time of day do you plan to work on this?

How many hours per day can you dedicate?

Daily breakdowns

Task dependencies

Estimated progress milestones
